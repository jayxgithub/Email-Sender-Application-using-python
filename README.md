# Email Sender Application

This is a Python-based Email Sender application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. The application allows users to send emails to multiple recipients, schedule emails, save drafts and templates, and view email history.

## Features

- **Send Emails:** Send emails to one or multiple recipients with attachments.
- **Schedule Emails:** Schedule emails to be sent at a specified time and date.
- **Save Drafts:** Save your email content as a draft for later use.
- **Templates:** Save and load email templates for repetitive tasks.
- **Attachments:** Attach multiple files to your emails.
- **Email History:** Track the history of sent emails, including timestamps, sender, receiver, and subject.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-sender-app.git
   cd email-sender-app

Important Security Note:
For Gmail, if you are using your regular Gmail password, it may not work due to security settings. Instead, you should use an App Password. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your Google account if you haven't already.

Generate an App Password:

Go to your Google Account settings.
Navigate to "Security."
Under "Signing in to Google," select "App passwords."
You might be prompted to sign in again.
Under "Select the app and device you want to generate the app password for," choose "Mail" as the app and "Windows Computer" (or whichever option is applicable) as the device.
Click "Generate."
Google will provide a 16-character app password. Use this app password instead of your regular Gmail password in your application.
